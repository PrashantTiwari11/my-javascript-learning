Events in JS -:
: The change in the state of an object is known as an eevent.
: Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execcution.

Syntax:- 
node.event = () => {
    //handle here
}

Inline Handling has less priority than javascript handling.

Event Object :- 
: It is a special object that has details about the event.
: All event handlers have access to the event object's properties and methods.

Syntax :
node.event = (e) => {
    //handle here
}

Event Listeners :- 
: node.addEventListener(event , callback)
: node.removeEventListener(event , callback)
Note :- the callback reference should be same to remove
